## Technical Assessment

1. Create a Laravel REST API where users can sign up and login.

Authentication should be handled using Laravel Passport.
Users should be able to add tasks.
Users should be able to fetch all the tasks theyâ€™ve added.
Users should be able to delete tasks.
 

Source code will be inspected, so make sure Eloquent ORM and its relationships are used.

 

2. Integrate Your API using a ReactJS frontend user interface, which should be designed to your taste.

- Make use of functional components only and as many varieties of hooks as needed.
